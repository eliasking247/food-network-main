            <p>It sounds so simple: Don't eat or drink too much. But looks can be deceiving. It's easy to eat or drink
                more
                than you planned to.Healthy dietary practices start early in life â€“ breastfeeding fosters healthy growth
                and improves cognitive development, and may have longer term health benefits such as reducing the risk
                of becoming overweight or obese and developing NCDs later in life.A healthy eating pattern should be
                primarily composed of whole foods like vegetables, fruits, beans, nuts, seeds, whole grains, and protein
                sources like eggs and fish. Hydrate the smart way. Staying hydrated is part of healthy eating, and water
                is the best way to stay hydrated.</p>
